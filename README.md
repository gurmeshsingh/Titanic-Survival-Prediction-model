# Titanic Survival Prediction (Scikit-Learn, Python)

A reproducible ML pipeline to predict Titanic passenger survival using Logistic Regression (baseline) on the classic Kaggle dataset. Includes clear preprocessing, evaluation, and Kaggle-style submission generation.

## 🔍 Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict `Survived` (0/1) from passenger data.
- **Tech:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn.
- **Baseline:** Logistic Regression with standardization.
- **Observed train-set accuracy:** ~0.80 (on full-train prediction in exploratory phase).

## 📁 Data
Place these files in `data/`:
- `train.csv` (required)
- `test.csv` (required)
- `gender_submission.csv` (optional, for quick local comparison)
